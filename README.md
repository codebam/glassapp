This is an Application for Google Glass

__STABLE__ is a directory for code that has been polished and is ready to go for all the users. It will be pushed asap to the application server

__UNSTABLE__ is a directory for code that is not stable enough for average users and may not work properly. It is code that may or may not be polished off and added to later builds.

__BUGS__ is a directory for bugs, every bug indexed in index.xml
